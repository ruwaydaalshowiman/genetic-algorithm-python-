# genetic algorithm using python
## problem
You are invited to an event but not sure what to wear, which happens 99% of the times J You stared at your wardrobe for a while, then decided to go shopping! You went to your favorite store and found the stock in the table below. Your goal is to optimize your look, which consists of pieces from all categories (top, bottom, shoes, neck, and purse) given a dress code, color pallet, and budget. Since you have a limited budget, you are not sure which piece you should buy and which you should get from your own wardrobe. In the table below, pieces with SAR0.0 prices indicate wardrobe pieces.
## Aim
Implement a GA algorithm to find the best outfit. The code should work as follows; the user enters a dress code (options include casual, sportswear, business, and evening), color pallet (such as dark and bright), and budget=[SAR 0.0 ‚Äì SAR‚àû]. Your GA will then run to find the best pieces from each category that maximize your fitness function and output the items.
Your fitness function includes three parameters; dress code, color pallet, and budget. The dress code and budget are equally important and the color pallet is half important. Your fitness function can be designed as weighted sum and importance of factors can be encoded as weights wi in the fitness function, where Œ£ ùë§% = 1. Please note that your fitness function value must be in the range [0,1].
